## My Bowling Scorecard

This is a project I worked on as a weekend challenge during my experience at Makers.<br>
The idea was to create a Bowling Scorecard allowing the user to keep track of their score throughout a match. This web app is designed to be very intuitive and easy to use.<br>
When I started working on this project I spent a relevant amount of time planning. I did not know the bowling score calculation rules and, once I understood them, I had to find a way to gently ask JavaScript to help me out :smile:. <br>
I began from the back-end and I created a client-side app. I haven't started working on the front-end until my app was perfectly working on the console. <br>
